# smartseed
Smart Seed Analyzer is an AI-powered system that leverages image processing and deep learning to evaluate the quality of agricultural seeds. By using OpenCV for preprocessing and TensorFlow for classification, it identifies defects such as shape irregularities, discoloration, and damage. A full Pytest-based unit test suite ensures reliability, making the tool robust and ready for real-world deployment. The project aims to assist farmers and agricultural industries in improving crop yield by selecting high-quality seed.
